**MACHINE LEARNING**

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. 
Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

Semi-supervised machine learning algorithms fall somewhere in between supervised and unsupervised learning, since they use both labeled and unlabeled data for training – typically a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. The systems that use this method are able to considerably improve learning accuracy. Usually, semi-supervised learning is chosen when the acquired labeled data requires skilled and relevant resources in order to train it / learn from it. 
Otherwise, acquiringunlabeled data generally doesn’t require additional resources.

Reinforcement machine learning algorithms is a learning method that interacts with its environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards. 
Trial and error search and delayed reward are the most relevant characteristics of reinforcement learning.
This method allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context in order to maximize its performance. Simple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn which action is best; this is known as the reinforcement signal.

In contrast, unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled.
Unsupervised learning studies how systems can infer a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data.

The system doesn’t figure out the right output, but it explores the data and can draw inferences from datasets to describe hidden structures from unlabeled data.

**Machine learning tasks are typically classified into several broad categories:**

Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. 
As special cases, the input signal can be only partially available, or restricted to special feedback.

Semi-supervised learning:The computer is given only an incomplete training signal: a training set with some (often many) of the target outputs missing.
Active learning: The computer can only obtain training labels for a limited set of instances (based on a budget), and also has to optimize its choice of objects to acquire labels for.
When used interactively, these can be presented to the user for labeling.

Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input.

Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).

Reinforcement learning: Data (in form of rewards and punishments) are given only as feedback to the program's actions in a dynamic environment, 
such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent.
